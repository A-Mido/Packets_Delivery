## Project Description

There are many techniques and protocols by which data transmitted and recieved on network.
For example on while searching on the Internet you are sending requests to certain data and receving responsed to your requests with the data you need if your request a file to download the server will respond to you by transmitting this file.
if the packet switching technique is used in this network and most probably it is. your requested file will be divided into small packets and then transmit those packets throught the network if the networks id connection-less the packets will take different routes at the end they will be recevied, but the data packets may arrives out of order and duplicated due to retransmission.
to get the file we requested an algorithm has to be followed to order the recived packets.

this repo is a short c++ code to demonstrate how we could handel something like that.
